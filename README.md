# My Video Profile
My personal video library, powered by **Microsoft Onedrive and Clipchamp**.

### What I do here?
I make videos using **[Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/)** and it is streamed and stored using **[Onedrive](https://onedrive.live.com/).**
I add the videos in this **profile directory.**

### Video times!
I will upload a video at least **1 to 3 times a month**
**NOTE: Due to many factors, I might skip or delay uploading vidoes. Please be patient**

Content creation is not something you can do in like **2 minutes.** It takes time to make **good content,** You might all think something like *"AI video generation,"* but that technology is **still evoloving** and is **NOT the best pick for me.**

Content creation is hard and takes a lot of image copying from sources. **I am no gigachad expert content creator** who can make a 20 minute video in just like **10 minutes or so.** 

### Tags in Videos
Here are some tags that I will use **(Might change according to the topics)**:
* #Productivity
* #Nocode
* #AI
* #Gameplay
* #Scratchdev
* #LinkInBio
